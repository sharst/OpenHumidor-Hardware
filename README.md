I have included former versions of the PCB in separate folders. 

Versions 2 and 3 were created using the free version of EAGLE. Since version 4, boards are created with KICAD. 

## Ordering PCBs
Attention! The current tested version is v4. It is running well but it needs some tweaks (see red wires in photo above). If you are interested in this project, contact me or follow the updates this site. I have ordered version 5 which fixes those bugs and it should arrive in a few weeks' time. 

So far, I have only ordered with two companies: 
* [PCB-pool](www.pcb-pool.de), located in Germany, the cheapest option takes about 2 weeks incl. shipping, you can directly upload the .kicad_pcb-file. 
* [Seeed Studio](http://www.seeedstudio.com/service/index.php?r=pcb), located in China and a lot cheaper (~14Euros for 10 pcbs). Takes about a month including shipping. You need to upload the .zip-file that's included in the gerber/ folder.
