I have included former versions of the PCB in separate folders. 

Versions 2 and 3 were created using the free version of EAGLE. Since version 4, boards are created with KICAD. 

## Ordering PCBs
The current version of the board is v0.6-mega. I'm currently testing all functions but minor bugs might still occur. If you're interested in trying out this project, you should consider contacting me.

So far, I have only ordered with two companies: 
* [PCB-pool](www.pcb-pool.de), located in Germany, the cheapest option takes about 2 weeks incl. shipping, you can directly upload the .kicad_pcb-file. 
* [Seeed Studio](http://www.seeedstudio.com/service/index.php?r=pcb), located in China and a lot cheaper (~14Euros for 10 pcbs). Takes about a month including shipping. You need to upload the .zip-file that's included in the gerber/ folder.
